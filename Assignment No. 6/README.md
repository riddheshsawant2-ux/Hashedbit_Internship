React Todo App

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Features implemented:
- Add tasks via `Add` button or Enter key
- Input is cleared and focused after adding
- Delete tasks with `Delete` button
- Tasks are listed in ascending (alphabetical) order
- Tasks persisted to `localStorage`

Notes:
- Focus is returned to the input after add/delete for better UX
- No custom CSS required — visual layout uses inline styles only
