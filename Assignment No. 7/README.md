# IPL 2022 Points Table

This is a minimal React-based page that fetches IPL Season 2022 points data and displays a table sorted in ascending order by NRR.

How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or via `File → Open`).
2. The page uses CDN React + Babel for development; no build step required.

Notes

- The data is fetched from: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/FreSauce/json-ipl/data
- Sorting is done by numeric NRR ascending (lowest first).

If you want, I can convert this into a create-react-app project or add team logos and responsive styles.
